# 📊 Regional Sales Analysis — EDA & Power BI Dashboard

## 🧩 Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing **5 years of regional sales data** to uncover key business insights, identify growth opportunities, and support data-driven decision-making. The analysis was conducted using **Python (EDA)** and visualized using an **interactive Power BI dashboard**.

## 🎯 Business Problem
The company faced inconsistent revenue and profit performance across U.S. regions, lacking visibility into:
- Seasonal sales patterns
- Top-performing SKUs and channels
- Regional profitability differences

**Goal:** Build data-driven insights and an interactive dashboard to optimize regional sales strategy.

## 🧼 Data Pre-Processing
- Merged multiple raw tables: **Sales**, **Products**, **Customers**, **Regions**, and **Budgets**  
- Standardized column names  
- Removed redundant columns  
- Created new features:  
  - `profit` = revenue - cost  
  - `profit_margin_pct` = profit / revenue * 100  
- Verified: No missing or duplicate records

## 📊 Key Insights

| Area | Findings |
|------|-----------|
| **Seasonality** | Revenue peaks in May–June, drops in January |
| **Top Products** | SKUs 26 & 25 generate ~25% of total sales |
| **Channels** | Wholesale = 54% of sales; Export = highest margin (~38%) |
| **Geography** | California dominates sales ($230M); West region leads overall |
| **Customers** | “Aibox Company” contributes highest revenue |
| **Correlations** | Unit price drives profit (corr = 0.79) more than quantity |

## 💡 Recommendations
1. **Seasonal Promotions:** Boost sales in low months (Jan–Apr)  
2. **SKU Optimization:** Focus on top 25% of products, phase out low-margin SKUs  
3. **Channel Strategy:** Expand export partnerships and incentivize wholesale volume  
4. **Regional Focus:** Replicate California’s success model in Midwest & Northeast  
5. **Margin Alerts:** Monitor and improve low-margin orders
